Future Plans
=================================

As of this writing, PySci is a fairly minimal wrapper around the existing
QsciScintilla widget. It provides a few convenience features, but nothing
earth-shattering. Here are some features that may appear in the future:

- Support for choosing syntax highlighting for any of the language lexers that
  QsciScintilla supports
- Direct attribute-based wrappers around the getter/setter methods
- Loading and saving of files, with auto-detection of syntax highlighting based
  on filename extension
- Loading and saving of PySci configuration preferences
- Built-in docstrings for the standard QsciScintilla methods
