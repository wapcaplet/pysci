PySci
=================================

This module attempts to provide a more Pythonic interface to the QsciScintilla_
editor widget. Although QsciScintilla is a rich and full-featured editor widget
that works nicely with PyQt4, its API is very C-like, and feels too low-level in
the context of a Python application. PySci was developed to bring a more
idiomatic Python approach to QsciScintilla.

Until PySci is officially released, you can install it from GitHub like so::

    $ git clone git://github.com/wapcaplet/pysci.git
    $ cd pysci
    $ pip install .
